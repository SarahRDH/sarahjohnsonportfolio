# sarahjohnsonportfolio
This is my web dev portfolio. I started this project with hand sketched wireframes, worked it up on Figma, and completed it in VS Code using command line and git for version control.
I used a mobile first approach for responsiveness and designed the DOM for accessibility.
Refactoring in progress.
